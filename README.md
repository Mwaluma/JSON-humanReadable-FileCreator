# JSON-humanReadable-FileCreator
Module that converts hard-to-read JSON files to human readable output file

a website that you want to query for information and creates an easy readable
JSON file

This is useful for developers who want to understand the details of the API
response for data analysis

   and convert it to an easy readable output file

   system
